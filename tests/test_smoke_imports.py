"""Smoke-import regression test (Directo pattern).

Catches the class of bugs where a module fails to import at runtime even
though it compiles cleanly. This pattern was lifted from directo_studio
v1.1.7 — they added a smoke-import step to CI after a string of releases
shipped through 5 quality gates with broken imports (missing `_` alias
in i18n shims, Gtk 3/4 removed methods, modules referenced in
manifests/entry-points that no longer exist).

The test imports each target in a fresh subprocess so a module-level
crash (e.g. torch.load without weights_only, yaml.load with FullLoader,
def __init__ that runs expensive work at class-definition time) is
isolated to that target's output instead of poisoning the whole pytest
session. The subprocess is a hard wall: even an OOM or segfault doesn't
take down the runner.
